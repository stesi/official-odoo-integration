## About MultiSafepay ##
MultiSafepay is a collecting payment service provider which means we take care of the agreements, technical details and payment collection required for each payment method. You can start selling online today and manage all your transactions from one place.


## What is Odoo 13 eCommerce?
Odoo is an open source software founded in 2004 by a student. Firstly known as OpenERP, the brand changed its focus from an ERP solution to a suite of business applications. More than 360 apps are available thanks to the multiple developments made by Odoo S.A. and its community. Some of these apps are officially validated by Odoo, whereas others developed by the community are dedicated to specific versions for specific needs.

Odoo is available in three editions: Community, Enterprise, and Online. The Community edition can be downloaded free of charge via the Odoo website. The Enterprise edition offers more features but comes with a yearly cost. The Online offer is the equivalent of the Enterprise version but hosted in the cloud and monthly billed. For this comparison, we choose to compare the Enterprise edition.

__Odoo platform currency rate__ is used for conversions and it is configured by a system administrator.
